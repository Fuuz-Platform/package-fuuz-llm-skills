# FUUZ Skills

Claude Code skills for building applications on the [FUUZ](https://fuuz.app) MES platform — covering data modeling, package generation, screen design, data flows, GraphQL/JSONata, industrial operations, and ML telemetry.

## What Are FUUZ Skills?

FUUZ Skills are [Claude Code skill files](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) (`.skill` archives) that teach Claude how to build, deploy, and manage applications on the FUUZ platform. Each skill is self-contained and can be imported into any Claude Code environment via the admin console.

They're designed for **FUUZ developers, partners, and customers** who want Claude to understand FUUZ platform conventions, data model patterns, and best practices out of the box.
